      <p><img src="../img/karl-marx.png" width="80" height="80" alt="Karl Marx" class="articleImg"> Karl Marx (1818–1883) was a German theorist, social activist and writer who analysed the effects of capitalism—an economic system in which private individuals own businesses and control the economy. Believing that capitalism corrupted human nature, Marx hoped for a utopia in which equality reigned. At his core, Marx was not that different from Comte, because he wished to understand society to improve it for all.</p>
      <p> Marx was interested in 'the material conditions of production—the circumstances under which labour is organised and things are produced' (Maynard 1989: 46, original emphasis). Marx suggested that in a capitalist system, the bourgeoisie, or members of the capitalist class, own most of the wealth because they control the businesses. Since increasing profit is their first goal, owners pay workers as little as possible. Liebow, too, notices this when he encounters homeless women who actually have some form of employment, but don't make enough money to afford housing. Employers generally pay these women as little as possible, and the women have no way to fight the system.</p>
      <p> Marx called the workers in a capitalist system the proletariat, or members of the poor working class. They do all the work and the owners reap all the benefits. The proletariat live in an unending cycle in which they work for low pay and then use those wages to survive. According to Marx, workers will never get ahead if they don't share in the wealth they create. Marx's position is usefully summarised by esteemed sociologist Anthony Giddens:</p>
      <p> According to Marx, capitalism is hence intrinsically a class society; and the class relations upon which it is founded are intrinsically ones of conflict or struggle. Employers and workers from being confined to the early stages of capitalist development, would become progressively more acute over time. (1986: 35–36) </p>
      <p>Why don't workers do something to change their fate? Marx suggested that it was because people had a false consciousness, or a lack of understanding of their position in society. The workers felt that they were alone in their plight. Marx proposed that the workers must develop class consciousness, or an understanding of one's position in the system. Marx suggested that most workers don't truly understand how capitalism enslaves them. They think if they work hard, they will get by and perhaps thrive. Marx argued that these ideas were fantasy.</p>
      <p> However, workers are not completely determined by the circumstances in which they find themselves, for Marx believed that, if workers are able to recognise their positions and understand that they can be agents of social change, then they can unite to end their tyranny and 'transform the nature of society' (Maynard 1989: 46). Marx proposed an overthrow of the private ownership of capitalism, and suggested socialism as its alternative. In such a system, the government controls the economic system, ensuring that all people share in the profits generated by their own labour.</p>
      <p> However, Marx didn't suggest that long-term government repression was necessary to enforce communism on people, and he believed that members of the capitalist class would willingly share their wealth once they saw the benefits of communal living (Marx 1964). It was never Marx's intention for his ideas to be taken up by oppressive communist regimes outside of the first world 'in order to promote a maintenon-
        capitalist modernization of their economies and societies' (Blackburn 2007: 101).</p>
      <p> Sociologists' opinions on Marxist theory vary. While some may hope for a type of class consciousness to arise and replace our current system, others think Marx oversimplified class struggle. His simple system of social class is difficult to apply to a complex post-industrial capitalist society, and even if you try, where would you draw the line between owners and workers? For example, if someone was employed by a company in which they also owned shares, would they be considered a worker, an owner, or both?
        Marxist theory clearly remains active in today's discussions of sociology, and these ideas continue to inspire sociologists. Let us next look at the work of two other conflict theorists, Pierre Bourdieu and Raewyn Connell, to consider how power can affect a society.</p>
