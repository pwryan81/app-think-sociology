Merton (1910–2003), a contemporary of Parsons, sought to create a middle-range theory that could bridge the gap between grand theories and the study of individual parts of society. He did this by breaking society into parts and studying them individually to better understand the whole (Merton 1957). </p>
      <p>This idea is widely accepted in sociology today, as most sociologists have an area of expertise, be it ethnicity, gender, crime, inequality, population, or a host of other issues. It is possible to spend a career pursuing knowledge in one of these areas, seeking to create theories of the middle range that describe these issues and how they influence society. Merton's work also shows how sociologists are rarely 'pure' theorists in any area.</p>
      <p> One of Merton's greatest theoretical contributions to functionalism was his understanding that social realities have both intended and unintended functions—social factors that affect people in a society. Merton identified two types: manifest functions, or factors that lead to an expected consequence or outcome; and latent functions, or factors that lead to an unforeseen or unexpected consequence. He developed this distinction in order to 'preclude the inadvertent confusion . . . between conscious motivations for social behaviour and its objective consequences' (Merton [1957] 2007: 441, original emphasis). </p>
      <p>Merton suggested that when looking at any social event, sociologists should ask the question, 'For whom is this functional?' By doing this, we will do a complete analysis because we will consider both manifest and latent functions. Merton (1957) uses the example of the rain-making ceremony of the Native American Hopi tribe to explain this. While the ceremonies are performed by tribe members in the belief that rain will be produced, an unintended consequence, or latent function, is that these ceremonies 'maintain the Hopi society by reinforcing the feelings of solidarity among its members' (Cuff and Payne 1981: 47). </p>
      <p>The ceremonies don't actually produce rain (the manifest function), but they do help strengthen tribal bonds (a latent function). For Merton, one cannot complete a functional analysis without considering both manifest and latent functions. </p>
      <p>Merton also reminds us that just because a social system appears to fulfil certain functions within a society, it may not necessarily be the only system that could fulfil that function. In other words, there might be what he calls 'functional alternatives' that 'may be able to perform the same task' (Wallace and Wolf 2006: 53). This is an important point, as Merton is rejecting the idea that 'existing institutions are necessary and, by implication, good' (Wallace and Wolf 2006: 53).</p>
