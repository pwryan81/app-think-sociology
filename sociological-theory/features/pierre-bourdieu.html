      <p><img src="../img/thumb.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="Pierre Bourdieu" class="articleImg">Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002) (pronounced Bord-yer), is perhaps the best known of the contemporary French sociologists and also one of the most prolific, having published in excess of 400 articles. He contributed a suite of concepts to the analysis of society—habitus, field and capital.</p>
      <p> Power was a current running through much of Bourdieu's work, and he believed power could not be reduced simply to a question of class but that one's position in society is also related to matters of culture and education. He introduced the concept of 'field' as a way to explain how people, acting in a social arena, 'maneuver, develop strategies, and struggle over desirable resources.</p>
      <p>A field, in other words, is a system of social positions, structured internally in terms of power relations' (Wallace and Wolf 2006: 112–113). Where Marx would trace these power relations back to the field of production (economic capital), Bourdieu argues that power is linked to various forms of capital. Economic capital, of course, but also the amount of cultural capital (what you know) and social capital (who you know) that an individual holds. </p>
      <p>We can see these ideas in Morris, Judd and Kavanagh's (2005) work on homelessness, as they argue that social and/or cultural capital can provide a buffer against becoming homeless in later life—it is not just a matter of economic capital. Bourdieu sees the system of capital as being reproduced through each individual's habitus—the durable 'values and dispositions gained from our cultural history' which enable individuals to respond to the social world in various ways, but only in ways that have been 'largely determined—regulated—by where (and who) we have been' in that world (Webb, Schirato and Danaher 2006: 36–37).</p>
      <p> In discussing power, Bourdieu has 'a specific focus on how the symbolic dimension of domination contributes to the maintenance and enhancement of social inequality by masking its underlying social, economic and political realities' (Swartz 2007: 42). This is a 'violence', in Bourdieu's view, which is 'exercised upon a social agent with his or her complicity' (Webb, Schirato and Danaher 2006: 25). </p>
      <p>Because we take the social world, and how we are treated within it, for granted we don't perceive ourselves as subject to symbolic violence but rather see our situation as 'the natural order of things' (Webb, Schirato and Danaher 2006: 25). Bourdieu asked: Why does domination continue to exist within and between generations? The answer, he said, was to be found in the study of the ways in which 'cultural resources, processes and institutions hold individuals and groups in competitive and self-perpetuating hierarchies of domination' (Swartz 2007: 42).</p>
