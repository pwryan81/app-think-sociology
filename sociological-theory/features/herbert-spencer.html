      <p>Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) was a British intellectual whose ideas furthered the development of functionalism. Spencer's study of sociology was informed by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection. Darwin argued that natural selection—a process resulting in the evolution of organisms best adapted to the environment—makes evolution occur. Spencer viewed society as a biological organism, and as such, it can evolve, thrive or die. For him, some societies are 'more fit' than others because they adapt better to changes in the environment. From Spencer, you can see a type of thinking often called 'social Darwinism'—a notion that suggests strong societies survive and weak ones become extinct (Turner, Beeghily and Powers 1998).</p>
      <p><br>
        Spencer's idea informs a social theory that, in essence, evaluates the superiority or inferiority of a society based on its ability to be strong and survive. In what ways might we see Spencer's ideas in the following comment: 'Homeless people cannot follow the rules that everyone else does; their homelessness is their own fault.' How do these words reflect the idea of social Darwinism? Or if we think back to the chapter opening, how might a social Darwinist view those 225 000 older Australians who didn't accumulate wealth over their working life and so now find themselves in danger of becoming homeless? Would the argument be that this is a case of 'survival of the fittest'? What about on a more macro level? Do you think some societies are superior to others? Would you suggest that a country like the United States, for example, popularly described as a super-power, reached its success due to its own merit? If so, you think a bit like a social Darwinist.</p>
