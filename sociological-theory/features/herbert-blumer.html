      <ol>
        <li> Human beings behave towards things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.</li>
        <li> The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and society.</li>
        <li> These meanings are handled in and modified through an interpretive process used by the person in dealing with the things he or she encounters (Blumer 1969).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Blumer proposed that the primary focus of the interactionist approach involves studying individual interactions with symbols. This micro focus places great importance on the idea that symbols have great power to affect society as a whole. The way we talk about something creates the way we deal with it. </p>
      <p>Consider this example: In the 1950s, many white people spoke using racial slurs. Today, such language is socially unacceptable. Has this change eliminated racism? Certainly not, but the level of racism in Australia and New Zealand has certainly declined. Are these two factors connected? Blumer would suggest that they are. Words convey meaning and meaning creates reality. Eliminating racist language moves society closer to eliminating racism. This doesn't mean that Blumer doesn't view structures, such as ethnicity, as important, but rather he believes that 'Structural features . . . set conditions for their [people's] action but do not determine their action' (Blumer [1969] 2007: 77).</p>
      <p>
        Normally, people interpret the words and actions of those around them and determine their behaviour based on this interpretation. This results in rational behaviour, meaning that we tailor our responses to the setting after we have interpreted the reactions. However, in a group setting our behaviours are somewhat different. Generally, Blumer suggests that in a group setting we react without the same degree of thought we use in an individual decision. At some point, people stop thinking rationally and act in ways that they might not consider acceptable in a different setting. </p>
      <p>Blumer would suggest that irrational acts are the result of collective excitement, an intense emotional behaviour that makes it hard for us to think and act rationally. This is what Blumer calls contagion, a rapid, irrational mode in which people don't think rationally or clearly. In such a setting, they 'lose their heads' and react emotionally, not rationally. In this way, you can see that individual interactions can create social realities. How do we react when others are watching? Sociologist Erving Goffman developed a theory about this.</p>
