      <p><img src="../img/emile-durkheim.png" width="80" height="80" alt="Emilie Durkheim" class="articleImg"> Like Spencer, French intellectual Emile Durkheim (1858–1917) also viewed society as an organism. You will recognise Durkheim's name from our discussion of suicide in Chapter 1. Along with Karl Marx and Max Weber (who you will be introduced to later in this chapter), Durkheim is widely considered to be one of the three key contributors to the development of sociological thought (Thompson 2007). In particular, his work contributed significantly to the development of functionalism.</p>
      <p><br>
        Durkheim's work suggested that solidarity is a vital component that holds society together. Solidarity integrates, or holds society together, because people see themselves as unified by a collective consciousness—common beliefs and sentiments held by people. He points out that the type of society influences the type of solidarity. Durkheim divided solidarity into two different types, mechanical and organic. Mechanical solidarity refers to the state of community bonding in traditional societies in which people share beliefs and values and perform common activities. Durkheim provides criminality as an example; 'we may state that an act is criminal when it offends the strong, well-defined states of the collective consciousness' (Durkheim [1893] 2007: 163). It is this bond, of pursuing and ensuring collective ends, that works to keep society running smoothly (Durkheim [1893] 2007).</p>
      <p><br>
        As societies become more complex, their type of solidarity changes from mechanical to organic. Organic solidarity occurs when people live in a society with a diverse division of labour. 'Division of labour' refers to the many different jobs we have today. This forces people to depend on one another for survival. Ask yourself, when was the last time you ate something you either grew or killed yourself? For most of us, the answer is 'never'. Food is essential for survival, and yet most of us require a complex division of labour to feed ourselves. Truck drivers, grocers and farmers all must do their part so that we can eat (Durkheim [1893] 2007). This organic connection ensures that we get the things we need and society is held together. Beliefs remain important in a modern society, but what binds people together is their organic solidarity (Durkheim [1893] 2007).<br>
        Look closely at Durkheim's explanation of the different types of solidarity and see if you can identify the ways in which his approach could be considered functionalist:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><br>
          <em>Whereas [mechanical] solidarity implies that individuals resemble one another, [organic solidarity] assumes that they are different from one another. . . . Indeed, on the one hand each one of us depends more intimately upon society the more labour is divided up, and on the other, the activity of each one of us is correspondingly more specialised, the more personal it is. . . . Here, then, the individuality of the whole grows at the same time as that of the parts. Society becomes more effective in moving in concert, at the same time as each of its elements has more movements that are peculiarly its own. ([1893] 2007: 170–171).</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><br>
        Durkheim's ideas about solidarity are just the tip of the iceberg, though. A number of American thinkers drew inspiration from Durkheim and expanded his ideas into what is known as functionalist thought. We will discuss this further in the following profiles.</p>
