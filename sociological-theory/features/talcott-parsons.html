      <p><img src="../img/thumb.jpg" width="80" height="80" alt="Talcott Parsons" class="articleImg"> Functionalist Talcott Parsons (1902–1979) was a key figure in the field of sociology in the United States. Parsons was interested in creating grand theories that attempted to explain every aspect of the human experience and how social systems interconnect. Parsons argued that, for a social system to operate, four basic conditions—what he called 'functional imperatives'—must be met. These are summarised by Cuff and Payne as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong> Adaptation to the environment. </strong>Any society must meet the physical needs of its members if it is to survive. . . .</li>
        <li><strong> Goal attainment.</strong> Any society must have some common agreement between its members about their priorities and aims. . . . </li>
        <li><strong> Pattern maintenance and tension management.</strong> Any society has to make sure that its members are sufficiently motivated [to carry out their social roles] . . . and able to manage the emotional tensions . . . [of daily] social interaction.</li>
        <li><strong> Integration.</strong> In order to maintain its existence, any society has to ensure a measure of coordination and control between the internal elements of the various parts of the social system. (1981: 35)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Looking at these four 'functional imperatives', we can see that, for Parsons, society was much like a bicycle wheel, made up of independent yet interdependent parts. When properly balanced, each independent spoke connected to the hub keeps the wheel spinning. But if just one spoke breaks on your wheel, the entire wheel will eventually fall out of balance. Similarly, society is an interrelated system, and if one part fails to work, the whole system suffers (Parsons 1951). </p>
      <p>As John Scott points out, 'All processes within a system, according to Parsons, must either contribute to the reproduction and patterned development of the system or be &quot;dysfunctional&quot;', and that dysfunction is the result of individuals failing to be socialised 'into the motivational patterns that allow them to reproduce the social structures' (2007: 189).</p>
      <p> If the functional imperatives are closely adhered to by the social system, does that mean society always stays the same? Parsons commented on the inertia of social systems, meaning that they tend to remain at rest, if they are at rest, or stay in motion, if already in motion. Parsons pointed out that in order to change a society, some great force must impact the system or it will remain unchanged. This is because societies naturally will find a balance. Thus, change is unlikely and often disruptive. Of course, once the process of change starts, the system will continue on that path until some counter-reaction occurs due to social inertia (Parsons 1951).</p>
